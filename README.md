<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This website was built using <strong>ReactJS</strong> and <strong>Tailwind</strong>, which are both powerful tools to create interactive and attractive web pages. I also included gradient elements in the design, which adds an extra touch of beauty and sophistication to the overall look of the website.</p>
